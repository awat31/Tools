Hashing Code, Pin Generators Etc

Pin Generator - Generates every combination of pin from 0000 to 9999, for a phone pin brute force

WPS Pin Generator - Generates all Pins between 00000000 and 99999999. For a WPS pin brute force, this output will take up a lot of space.

TimeMod - This is a useful python module for generating runtime for scripts, use start = timemod.start() to begin, end = timemod.end() to finish, then timemod.runtime(start, end) to generate the time between, and how long the program has run.
